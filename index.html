            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Lil wayne began selling his albums in 1999 and found initial success, but it wasn't until the 2000s that he started taking off.
                It was at this point in 2004 when Wayne dropped 'Tha Carter' and shortly before releasing the album he founded Cash Money Records, his own record label.
                This record label would go on to sign an up and coming <b>Drake and Nicki Minaj</b>. Meaning, if it was not for Wayne (also known as Weezy) we wouldn't have two of
                the most successful hip-hop artists of the 2010s. It never came easy to Wayne. He consistently had to release new albums and singles for over a decade in order
                to earn the utmost respect of his peers in the industry. Later, it was Lil Wayne's prestige that made Drake and Nicki Minaj look up to him, and want to work with him. But Wayne's legacy
                is more than just one of the best mentors in modern music. For <u>generations now</u> he has had ups and downs but Wayne has <em>never <b>truly</b></em> fell off in the rap game.
